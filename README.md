# nn-chisel

Explore neural networks in Scala and Chisel.

## Next Steps

 * [ ] Add a test for the `Perceptron` class
 * [ ] Maybe do a ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) as a second step
   * Random middle layer weights and then learn the output weights
   * Solve the XOR problem
 * [ ] Do a simple feed forward NN
 * [ ] Implement learning
 * [ ] Explore it with an XOR function
 * [ ] Explore it with a MNIST dataset
