# nn-chisel

Explore neural networks in Scala and Chisel.

## Next Steps

 * [x] Add a test for the `Perceptron` class
 * [x] Do a MultilayerPerceptron (also called ELM (Extreme Learning Machine)) as a second step
   * Random middle layer weights and then learn the output weights
   * Solve the XOR problem
 * [ ] Do a simple feed forward NN
 * [ ] Implement learning
 * [ ] Explore it with an XOR function
 * [ ] Explore it with the MNIST dataset
 * [ ] Use quantized weights for learning and inference
 * [ ] Generate Chisel code
 * [ ] Compare wiht quantized weights of "standard" learning methods
